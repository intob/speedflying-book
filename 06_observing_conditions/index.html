      <h1>Observing Conditions</h1>
      <p>Clouds offer many reliable indicators for the current weather conditions, and also some signs to help us predict the weather.</p>
      <h2>Stratus Drift</h2>
      <p>The drift of high clouds tells us about the wind at altitude.</p>
      <h2>Cumulus Drift</h2>
      <p>A very useful indicator for assessing the wind strength and direction at altitudes between terrain, up to and above cloudbase.</p>
      <p>I watch the displacement of cumulus relative to their triggers. The amount and direction of drift tells us about the strength and direction of the wind.</p>
      <p>With north wind, cumulus is pushed over the south side of a trigger. This can be observed by the position of the shade, which in this case will be on the south side of the trigger.</p>
      <h2>Over-development</h2>
      <p>Prevalent in the mid-to-late summer, over-development is the process of thermic activity developing into thunder storms. This can be observed by seeing large tall cumulus clouds developing into Cumulo-Nimbus giants. These giant clouds have dark bases, and look menacing. Be very conservative about flying in proximity to thunder storms. These conditions cause an initial in-flow towards the storm, and then an out-flow of wind with the rain.</p>
