      <h1>Takeoff</h1>
      <p>Footlaunching a speedwing involves inherent risk, however, we can greatly improve the safety with good technique and by following some best practices. A proper takeoff involves the following stages.</p>
      <h2>1. Pre-flight checks</h2>
      <p>Checking that your equipment is ready for flight is absolutely crucial. Always check the following before every flight:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your equipment is in working order, with no damage</li>
        <li>Your helmet is fastened</li>
        <li>Your harness is fully buckled up</li>
        <li>Your trim system is set for glide</li>
        <li>Your brake pulleys are clear</li>
        <li>Your lines are free from tension knots, with the A-lines on top</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>2. Inflate</h2>
      <p>Either in reverse, or by forward launching, you must inflate the glider until it is flying above your head.</p>
      <p>If you are following another pilot, you may prefer to do a forward launch, unless you are able to kite the wing above your head before you start together. Be very cautious of the turbulence generated by gliders starting in front of you. It is better to start side-by-side, if there is enough space.</p>
      <h3>Reverse</h3>
      <p>If there is enough wind for a reverse launch, you should prefer this. The advantage of a reverse launch is that the control and check phases are simultaneous, and more thorough. As such, you may skip your line check during pre-flight because you will get a good look at the glider as you inflate and control it. If you are unable to reverse launch, you should prioritise learning this by kiting on the ground. The valley wind of summer afternoons offers a good opportunity for this.</p>
      <h3>Forward</h3>
      <p>When forward launching, most people like to use the A risers because this helps the wing to pop up faster. If holding the A risers, you should have your hands far apart and slightly behind you, such that all lines become tensioned equally during inflation. You can move your hands forward slightly as you move, to bring the glider up.</p>
      <p>Before you begin, step forward until your A lines are slightly taught. You do not need to shock-load your lines.</p>
      <h2>3. Catch and control</h2>
      <p>Once the wing is above your head, you must catch it to prevent it from overshooting. Catch it with your brakes as you continue to move forward. Keep the glider under control, and level above your head. Don't let it overshoot, nor fall behind.</p>
      <h2>4. Visual check</h2>
      <p>Visually check that your glider is well inflated, without any cravatte or tension knot. Look to both the left and the right sides as you move forward.</p>
      <p>If you are reverse launching, you can skip this, as you should have done it very well during inflation.</p>
      <h2>5. Accelerate</h2>
      <p>With the glider above your head, under control, and visually checked, you are ready to take speed to fly. Smoothly and progressively accelerate, while gradually reducing your brake input. The aim here is to generate as much speed as possible by running, until you are airborne.</p>
      <p>Many pilots launch with too much brake. While brake increases angle of attack, it also reduces your speed. The more you brake, the less excess speed you can generate. The less excess speed you have, the less margin you have. Your glider will simply not fly until you have enough speed to make lift. The more speed you can build on the ground, the more margin you give yourself.</p>
      <p>If you cannot start your glider without brake input, in my opinion, you should take a larger size. Increasing your running top speed is possible with training.</p>
