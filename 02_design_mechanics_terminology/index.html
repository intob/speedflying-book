      <h1>Design, Mechanics, and Terminology</h1>
      <p>A speedwing consists of 3 main parts; the airfoil, the lines, and the risers.</p>
      <p>As you know from Airfoil Aerodynamics, the airfoil creates lift. The lines attach the airfoil to the risers, while the risers attach to your harness, and give you flight controls.</p>
      <p>The front of the airfoil is called the leading edge, while the rear is called the trailing edge.</p>
      <p>The risers and lines on most modern speedwings are split into 3 groups; A, B, C. Group A is located toward the leading edge, while group C is located toward the trailing edge. Behind group C are your brake lines and brake toggles, attached to the trailing edge. Both the left and right sides of the glider have separate line sets and risers.</p>
      <p>It is cruicial to be aware of the type of glider you are flying, and piloting appropriately for the given air conditions.</p>

      <h2>Pitch</h2>
      <p>Pitch is the rotation of the glider about its lateral axis (side-to-side).</p>

      <h2>Roll</h2>
      <p>Roll is the rotation of the glider about its longitudinal axis (font-to-back). Rolling the glider allows it to turn by ....... [altering wing load distribution?].</p>

      <h2>Yaw</h2>
      <p>Yaw is the rotation of the airfoil about its vertical axis (top-to-bottom). In paragliding, a glider exhibits yaw movement during a spin.</p>

      <h2>Line Length</h2>
      <p>Paragliders tend to have significantly longer lines than speedwings, with a few exceptions, such as the Bantam.</p>
      <p>The line length affects the handling characteristics of the glider in the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Longer lines give the glider more dive, as the recovery arc is lengthened.</li>
        <li>Longer lines result in the pilot experiencing more G-force during roll and pitch movements.</li>
        <li>Shorter lines increase the roll-rate of the glider, leading to more responsive handling. This is an important consideration for newer pilots, as gliders with a high roll-rate are more sensitive to weightshift and brake input.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Aspect Ratio</h2>
      <p>Both speedwings and paragliders alike are designed with an aspect ratio appropriate for their intended use-case and pilot ability.</p>
      <p>Gliders with a higher aspect ratio have better glide performance, at the cost of passive safety. Gliders with a higher aspect ratio typically have more cells, and therefore less pressure in each cell. This reduction in cell pressure makes the glider more succeptible to asymmetric collapse.</p>
      <p>Conversely, gliders with a lower aspect ratio have greater stability and therefore passive safety, at the cost of glide performance.</p>

      <h2>Pitch Control (Speed System)</h2>
      <p>Conventional paragliders, miniwings, and speedwings typically either a speedbar, a trim system, or the FLARE system to control the pitch of the glider.</p>
      <p>Paragliders, with the exception of tandems, use a speedbar design. A speedbar design consists of a pulley on the A-risers, connected by a cord running through the harness, to a bar operated by the pilot's feet.</p>
      <p>Conventional speedwings and tandem paragliders use a trim system, normally connected to the rear risers. The trim system consists of webbing running through a cam. When the cam is released, the load on the C-risers causes the webbing to run through the cam. This lengthens the C-risers, and to a lesser degree the B-risers, relative to the A-risers.</p>
      <p>The combined speed system is a much newer design, pioneered by the brand FLARE. This design combines a trim system consisting of two pulleys with the brake lines, connected at the brake toggles. This combined approach allows a pilot to simultaneously control trim and brake input.</p>
      <p>Additionally, some gliders, such as the Little Cloud Puffin, use a riser design with both a speedbar and trim system.</p>
      <p>It is exceptionally important to be aware of the manufacturer recommendations and warnings for proper use of these riser designs.</p>
      <p>These designs come with tradeoffs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>During a collapse, a speedbar should be released immediately, whereas a trim system cannot be adjusted in such short time. This makes asymmetric collapses with speedwings even more dangerous when trimmed with reduced angle of attack.</li>
        <li>Trim systems free the pilot from operating a speedbar with their legs. This allows the pilot to adopt a greater range of body positions.</li>
        <li>FLARE's combined system simplifies the brake and trim system by combining them. This makes the piloting very intuitive.</li>
        <li>FLARE's combined system greatly reduces the pilot's ability to control speed separately from pitch. This makes it more challenging to land precisely by shortening the flare with brake input.</li>
      </ul>
