      <h1>The "Power Curve"</h1>
      <p>When driving a car, the transition from a left turn into a right turn involves smoothly shifting the weight to the outside wheels. This is achieved by progressively increasing the steering angle.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the transition between turns while skiing requires the release of weight, and then gradual increase in load of the next edges.</p>
      <p>When riding a motorcycle, the transition between turns is also progressive.</p>
      <p>Speedflying is no exception, and the principles of carving remain the same. As the pilot begins a turn, they should smoothly and progressively increase the amount of weight-shift and control input.</p>
      <p>In order to make the optimal flare, the principle is the same; a progressive increase of bridge input, avoiding any sudden or erratic input. Sudden input results in lost energy, such as pumping brakes.</p>
      <p>I call this principle the "Power Curve" because rather than a linear progression over time, there is an easing in and out, resulting in a curve when graphed.</p>
