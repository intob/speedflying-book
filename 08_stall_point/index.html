      <h1>Stall point</h1>
      <p>Stall point is the point at which your glider reaches stall, where the air flows over the upper and lower surfaces become separated. Your best glide in still air is very close to your stall point, as this is typically where your glider produces maximum lift. If you wish to glide optimally and safely, you should become familiar with your stall point on the ground.</p>
      <p>I recommend kiting your wing in a strong valley breeze, or a sea breeze. Ideally, in a location that offers some terrain to produce mechanical lift. This will make the kiting and stalls more realistic. <strong>Only do this on the ground.</strong> In flight, a stall at high wing-load is violent, and there is a high risk of total loss of control.</p>
      <p>Try reaching the stall point, and releasing as the glider falls backwards. Try to do this consistently, while avoiding asymmetric stalls. You should aim to stall the glider symmetrically, without any spin.</p>
      <p>Try stalling with brakes, then with rears, and also on bridge. You should notice that the stall on brakes is heavy and progressive, whereas the stall on bridge comes with less warning.</p>
      <p>This practice is particularly useful before a soaring session, as you will be much safer and more confident flying at best glide, and also top landing.</p>
