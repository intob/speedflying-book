      <h1>Discovering Lines</h1>
      
      <p>When searching for lines, I primarily assess the following factors:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Landing options</li>
        <li>Takeoff options</li>
        <li>Steepness of line, ideally without flat sections that must be glided over</li>
        <li>Aspect and ideal conditions</li>
        <li>Accessibility, normally via hiking trails</li>
      </ol>

      <p>I tend to search mostly using maps, but I often find incredible lines while driving. If I see something that looks good while driving, I'll often stop to assess before saving the details for a later mission.</p>

      <p>Remarkably often, the landings that I spot by map are the ones that I end up using. The same goes for takeoffs. Maps are a fantastic tool for exploring entire massifs in a short time.</p>
