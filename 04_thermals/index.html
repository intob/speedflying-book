      <h1>Thermals</h1>
      <p>XC paragliders seek thermals, while the majority of speedflyers avoid them like the plague. If the majority of speedflyers had a paragliding background, this would not be the case.</p>
      <p>In the mountains, thermals indicate the presence of valley wind. Before flying, be sure to familiarise yourself with the topography of the valley that you are flying in, and the expected direction of any valley wind after thermic activity. On or near the coast, you can expect a sea breeze to develop following thermic activity, in much the same way as mountain valley wind.</p>
      
      <p>Flying a speedwing in thermic conditions is dangerous without proper consideration, awareness, active piloting skills, and well-trained positive reflexes to collapses. Variable air greatly increases the chance of collapses, and collapses are more likely to occur without active piloting. This is particularly true while flying with a reduced angle of attack. If you wish to fly safely during times of thermic activity, it is essential to maintain proper caution and awareness at all times. This practice is unsuitable for pilots lacking paragliding experience. Paragliding is the <strong>only</strong> way to safely practice active piloting and train positive reflexes to collapses.</p>
      <p>With that said, flying a speedwing in thermic conditions offers some advantages over calm conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Thermals result in lift at takeoffs that have been exposed to the sun, making takeoffs much easier.</li>
        <li>Valley wind and sea breeze offers headwind for landing, thus making landings easier with reduced ground speed at stall point.</li>
        <li>Lifty conditions allow pilots to make longer glides, accessing areas that can be inaccessible in calm air.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Valley wind poses the following risks to pilots flying paragliders and speedwings alike:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Turbulence in landings in the lee of terrain, buildings and trees.</li>
        <li>Turbulence in the lee of all terrain exposed to valley wind.</li>
      </ul>
