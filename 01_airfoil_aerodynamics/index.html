      <h1>Airfoil Aerodynamics</h1>

      <p>A basic understanding of the physics of flight will give you clarity and confidence, allowing you to progress faster. You will also save yourself from experimenting with suboptimal or dangerous practices.</p>
      <p>The fundamental principle that causes an airfoil to produce lift is a pressure differential between the upper and lowersurfaces. The convex form of the top surface forces air moving over airfoil to accelerate. According to the Bernoulli's principle, this acceleration results in a reduction in pressure, which causes lift. This holds true while the air flow over the top and lower surfaces are lamina.</p>
      <p>The reason that the wing is tapered at the rear is such that the two separate lamina flows can combine without turbulence, as this turbulence would reduce efficiency, or even cause the wing to stall.</p>
      <p>The reason that the front of the wing is fatter than the centre cross-section is that the asymmetry improves the efficiency of the convergence of air flow at the rear of the wing, ensuring lamina flow at high air speed.</p>

      <h2>What is an Airfoil?</h2>
      <p>An airfoil is the cross-sectional shape of an airplane wing or propeller blade. It is designed with a curved upper surface and a flatter lower surface to produce an aerodynamic lifting force as it moves through the air.</p>

      <h2>How Airfoils Generate Lift</h2>
      <p>Airfoils generate lift through a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's laws:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>As air flows over the curved upper surface of the airfoil, it speeds up and the pressure decreases, creating an area of low pressure above the wing.</li>
        <li>Simultaneously, the air flowing under the flatter bottom surface is slower, creating an area of higher pressure below the wing.</li>
        <li>This pressure difference results in an upward force on the wing, which is lift. The lift force acts perpendicular to the oncoming airflow.</li>
        <li>According to Newton's third law, as the airfoil pushes the air down, the air pushes the wing up with an equal and opposite reaction force, contributing to lift.</li>
        <li>The airflow over the top of the wing also has to travel a greater distance, which requires it to move faster to keep up with the air underneath, further reducing the pressure on top via Bernoulli's principle.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Angle of Attack</h2>
      <p>The angle of attack is the angle between the oncoming air and the chord line of the airfoil. A higher angle of attack deflects the air downward more sharply, increasing lift up to a point. If the angle is too high, the airflow separates from the top of the wing and stall occurs, dramatically reducing lift.</p>
      <p>That is to say that if the wing is pitched toward the air flow, the angle of attack is reduced. Conversely, if the wing is pitched away from the air flow, the angle of attack is increased. Exceeding the critical angle of attack, both positive or negative, will result in a stall. With a paraglider or speedwing, these conditions induce either a parachutal stall, or a frontal collapse.</p>

      <h2>Airfoil Shape</h2>
      <p>An asymmetric airfoil shape helps generate lift even at small angles of attack:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The rounded leading edge is insensitive to angle of attack changes</li>
        <li>The elongated shape moves the maximum thickness point backward to prevent flow separation</li>
        <li>Camber (curvature) increases lift and improves stall characteristics</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Thin Airfoil Theory</h2>
      <p>Thin airfoil theory relates the lift generated to the airfoil shape and angle of attack, using simplifying assumptions of inviscid, incompressible flow. It models the airfoil as a vortex sheet and uses the Kuttaâ€“Joukowski theorem to calculate lift.</li>

      <hr>
      
      <p>In summary, airfoils generate lift through a combination of pressure differences arising from their shape, and the deflection of air resulting in a reaction force. Their curved upper surface and angle of attack accelerate airflow to create low pressure, while the flatter underside maintains higher pressure. This pressure difference, along with the downward deflection of the airstream, produces the lift force that allows airplanes to fly. The specific airfoil shape is carefully designed to optimize lift for different flight conditions.</p>
      
      <h2>Stall</h2>

      <h3>What is an Airfoil Stall?</h3>
      <p>An airfoil stall occurs when the angle of attack of an airfoil exceeds its critical angle, causing a sudden decrease in lift. The airflow over the top surface of the wing separates from the surface, becoming turbulent and unsteady. This results in a dramatic loss of lift, increase in drag, and change in pitching moment.</p>

      <h3>Critical Angle of Attack</h3>
      <p>The angle of attack is the angle between the oncoming air (relative wind) and the chord line of the airfoil. As this angle increases, the lift produced by the airfoil also increases, up to a certain point called the critical angle of attack. This is typically around 15-20 degrees for most airfoils, but can vary based on the airfoil shape.</p>

      <h3>Boundary Layer Separation</h3>
      <p>At angles of attack below the critical angle, the airflow remains smoothly attached to the airfoil surface. However, as the critical angle is exceeded, the boundary layer separates from the top surface of the wing, starting near the trailing edge. This separated flow region grows larger as angle of attack increases further.</p>

      <h3>Stall Progression</h3>
      <p>The exact way a stall progresses depends on the airfoil shape:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Thick airfoils (&gt14% thickness) tend to stall gradually from the trailing edge. Lift decreases smoothly and stall is gentle.</li>
        <li>Moderately thick airfoils (6-14%) often have an abrupt leading edge stall with a sharp loss of lift.</li>
        <li>Thin airfoils (&lt6%) stall from the leading edge via a growing separated flow bubble. Lift loss is smooth but pitching moment changes significantly.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A speedwing will exhibit the stall of a thick airfoil, however, due to the high wing-load, stalls are abrupt and violent.</p>

      <p>A paraglider will stall gradually and comparitively slowly, whereas a speedwing will offer little warning. On a speedwing, the time between stall-point and full-stall is very short, especially at high wing-loads. The first sign is that the glider begins to vibrate, and wingtips nudge backwards as the glider enters the stall.</p>

      <h3>Consequences of a Stall</h3>
      <p>When an airfoil stalls, several things happen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lift decreases substantially, resulting in loss of height.</li>
        <li>Drag increases significantly, due to the turbulent separated flow.</li>
        <li>The wing may roll to one side if the stall is asymmetric. This must be countered immediately with weightshift, to maintain a safe heading.</li>
        <li>The effectiveness of brake input is greatly reduced due to the separated flow, increasing the importance of controlled weightshift.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Stall Recovery</h3>
      <p>To recover from a stall, the angle of attack must be reduced below the critical angle. The recovery procedure is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Reduce angle of attack by releasing any break or riser input.</li>
        <li>Maintain heading with centered and neutral weightshift. In the case of an asymmetric stall, weightshift away from the stalled side is cruicial.</li>
        <li>In the case of an asymmmetric stall, a spin is often induced. This must be handled by following the glider with your shoulders to avoid a twist.</li>
        <li>Wait for the glider to produce lift by allowing it to take speed.</li>
      </ol>

      <hr>

      <p>In summary, an airfoil stall is a serious in-flight condition caused by exceeding the critical angle of attack. It results in a large loss of lift, increase in drag, and potential loss of control. Pilots must act promptly to reduce the angle of attack and restore smooth airflow over the wings in order to recover from a stall. Understanding the aerodynamics of stalls is crucial for safe flying.</p>

      <p>In addition, SIV training with a paraglider is a safe way to gain experience with stalls. I highly recommend this for any pilot serious about maximising their safety while flying any type of paraglider, miniwing, or speedwing. This process will train you with proper reflexes, giving you the ability to recover from such scenarios. Positive reflexes are particularly important while flying speedwings, as these in-flight conditions are more violent at high wing-loads, and you will typically have less distance from terrain while speedflying. One might say that SIV training is more important than carrying a reserve while speedflying, as a preventative measure, rather than a reactive measure.</p>
      
      <p>Of course, I still recommend that you always fly with a helmet, reserve, back protector, and airbag.</p>
