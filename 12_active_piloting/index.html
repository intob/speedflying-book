      <h1>Active Piloting</h1>
      <p>While brief, this topic deserves a dedicated section as it is the basis for safe piloting in all types of variable air.</p>
      <p>By active piloting, the pilot inhibits pitch and roll movements of the glider with controlled counter inputs. This is normally achieved by maintaining light brake pressue, and smoothly reacting to movements as they occur. I find that the easiest way to do this is to relax your arms, and simply dampen glider movements, as opposed to fighting or preventing them. Go along with it, just a little bit. Just like a suspension system, don't bounce.</p>
      <p>This skill can be applied in any situation where you encounter variable air, such as while flying in thermic air, or during gusts while soaring.</p>
      <p>As with many other piloting techniques, the safest way to learn active piloting is by paragliding. Paragliding encourages you to learn this, as the flight becomes more comfortable once you have mastered this relatively simple technique. With that said, you should work on this technique whenever you have the chance. It will eventually become automatic.</p>
