      <h1>Landing</h1>
      <p>Landing a speedwing is very similar to landing a paraglider, and best practices remain mostly the same.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Assess wind direction</li>
        <li>Spot air traffic</li>
        <li>Approach landing</li>
        <li>Land into wind</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Start by assessing the wind direction, as your landing approach will depend on this. There are various indicators for wind direction:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wind socks</li>
        <li>Flags</li>
        <li>Waves on water</li>
        <li>Your drift as you glide</li>
      </ul>
      <p>During your landing approach, spot air traffic around the landing area.</p>
      <h2>Swooping</h2>
      <p>Swooping is the practice of taking speed for your landing flare. This is a rewarding practice, as it is hard to be consistently optimal. However, swooping poses some significant risks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Danger of being "heavy in the corner", too low</li>
        <li>Danger of overshooting the landing</li>
        <li>Danger of colliding with other gliders</li>
        <li>Danger of hitting people or objects in the landing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to progress slowly and avoid some practices altogether. I suggest that you never rotate quickly, as this makes it difficult to judge your final approach, and does not increase the amount of energy that you develop. Rather, I recommend rotating slowly, just enough to keep the glider in a steep dive. I also recommend carving a turn, as this allows you to moderate the path and radius, rather than trying to calculate a straight dive.</p>
      <p>Never over-estimate your height, be conservative. That is to say, if you lack the height for a 270, don't do a fast 270, but opt for a "bang bang", two hard turns. Energy is proportional to vertical speed, not angle of rotation.</p>
