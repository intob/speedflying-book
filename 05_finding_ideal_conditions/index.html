      <h1>Finding Ideal Conditions</h1>
      <p>In order to reliably find ideal conditions, we must consider the following factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>General weather</li>
        <li>Prevailing wind</li>
        <li>Thermic activity</li>
        <li>Local weather tendencies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Start by assessing the general weather forecast in the area that you are considering. Look for dry weather, ideally without inversions. As such, you can efficiently exclude unstable regions of low atmospheric pressure.</p>
      <p>If weather is predicted to be dry, check wind speed and direction at altitudes between ground and one or two hundred meters above the takeoff options.</p>
      <p>Ideal wind condition for a takeoff is either nil wind, or a light to moderate headwind.</p>
      <p>Then consider the aspect of the takeoff for timing of thermic activity.</p>
      <p>Large mountain ranges can have a strong influence on the weather. For example, the Lauterbrunnen valley is well sheltered from south foehn due to the massif to the south. Each valley has slightly different weather patterns, and you must become familiar with them before you can expect to reliably find ideal conditions.</p>
      <p>Bear in mind that thermic activity after precipitation results in reduced visibility due to low cloud formation.</p>
      <p>The best way to learn is to frequently make predictions, and test them by going for a look. The more you study forecasts and visit takeoffs, the more you will learn the local tendencies, and the better you will become at finding flyable conditions.</p>
