Contributing
----------------------------------------------------------------
I welcome changes and other contributions, such as illustrations. I plan to create good illustrations when I have time. If you're not sure how to make a pull request, I suggest that you create an issue, so that someone else can implement the changes for you, if the community agrees.

Why no Hugo?
----------------------------------------------------------------
I normally build such static websites with Hugo, but I felt that this pure HTML approach reduces the barrier to entry for contributors who want to make significant changes. While writing in markdown is much easier, installing the build dependencies, let alone learning about Hugo is too demanding for those without software developement experience. In addition, it's nice to have a simple and performant product without any external dependencies.
